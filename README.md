# The Compasses
Hey, we're the Compasses, a relatively small plural collective.

We're currently working on Stowage, a, momentarily private, continutation and improvement of our mod Expanded Storage.

We're also currently learning web development and aspiring to become a Full Stack Developer but it's still early days for that.

You may see our commits are relatively unique being authored by e.g. "Astra Belle" and commited by "Quinn Bailey", this is so we can have it attached to both who within the system authored the commit as well as our legal self.
